I'm a life long techie with increasing interest in Enterprise Architecture and ArchiMate. But before all Father, Husband, Guitarist and DIY addict. I have been working in the Lafarge Group (now [LafargeHolcim](http://www.lafargeholcim.com)) for more than 16 years. After all this time working in a rich, international, industrial context, I've acquired deep knowledge of how a well used IT can contribute to value creation. I now try to apply these competencies in a broader scope. For the past 3 years, I've been contributing to the well known OpenSource ArchiMate modelling tool [Archi](http://www.archimatetool.com). I also had the honnor to proofread [Gerben Wierda](http://enterprisechess.com/about)'s books: [Mastering ArchiMate](http://masteringarchimate.com/mastering-archimate-edition-ii) and [Chess and the Art of Enterprise Architecture](http://enterprisechess.com/the-book). I can only recommend you to buy and read them. The following quote is mentionned in the latest and, in my opinion, an all too common aspect of our work: dealing with cost and (perceived lack of) value...
