This site is an attempt to share [my](about-me.md) personal view about Enterprise Architecture: _more an art than a science._ You'll find a mix of personnal ideas and advices about tools and methods that I have some knowledge of. Despite being an IT Architect, I recognize the need for a real broader scope Enterprise Architecture (not to be confused with Enterprise-wide IT Architecture which focuses only on IT), thus I will most of the time try to reframe those ideas and advices in this context.

Beyond this site
--------------
I would encourage you if you don't already know them (but how could that be possible) to look at the fantastic job done by [Gerben Wierda](http://enterprisechess.com) and [Tom Graves](http://weblog.tetradian.com) to offer a fresh view on Enterprise Architecture.
