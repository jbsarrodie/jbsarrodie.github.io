Why [Archi](http://www.archimatetool.com) does matter!
====================
And not only for me
-----------------

There are some moment in life where you'd like to shout to the world and shake the whole thing. This is how I feel now. Why? Because one of the most useful software, and a fantastic adventure is about to end.


Rewind
-----

Long story short: back in 2010, a national (UK) project is launched to create an opensource ArchiMate modeller. Archi is born and will be funded for two more years. In 2013, this project stops but Phil Beauvoir (Archi's father) decides to continue the work on its own, without any earnings. Since then, his work has been incredible, making Archi the modeller that every architect has used at least once in its life. But what people don't (want to) see is that even if opensource is a great thing, people like Phil have to earn something in return or the whole project collapse and everybody loose. That's what is hapening now.


Collapse or cool apps?
-------------------

Why collapse some would ask: because maintaining such a high quality software for free is not sustainable. People have to understand that being open source doesn't mean that there is a whole bunch of guys working on it on their spare time. Such things can happen only for projects that are widely used (think Linux or Apache), but for an ArchiMate modeller this is not the case. Phil has been alone most of the time, and even if I have worked too on Archi for the past 3 years, I'd say that my contributions are minor ones (mainly fixing some bugs here and there, making better looking diagrams and reports). But anyway, I'm part of this adventure too and proud of it. Phil and I are a team and we exchange ideas (about Archi, life and the universe) on a daily basis.

So seen form the outside, users may think this is sustainble but it is not. The proof? Any big/major change would be impossible for someone not being paid for, that's why we actually add features but don't rework the heart, the foundations. But hey, wait a minute. Do you know the big news in the Enterprise Architecture world? The Open Group is gonna release the new version of the ArchiMate standard really soon (and I can tell you it will be a real step forward). But you know what? Archi is not gonna support it because this is the big/major change that I were talking about, the one that can't be done without rewriting the whole thing.

So here we are: _one of the most useful software, and a fantastic adventure is about to end._


Kick their ass
------------

And now what... Now I'd like to kick the ass of all people who have made money with Archi without donating in return. I don't want to blame end users because most of them can't afford commercial tools and Archi is a perfect solution for them: it allows them to focus on their EA practice and the really good language ArchiMate is instead of trying to convince their management to invest into commercial software. Of course they could have donated (and some did) but I know how difficult it could be for a company to donate without any invoice in return.

No, I'd like to kick the ass of consultants, training organisations and all the people who actually deliver some services using Archi but haven't donate anything. These companies and people have to pay The Open Group to use their standards, why not add some bucks and donate to Phil. Is it so difficult when you sell yourself several hundreds of dollars per days to deliver some work based on ArchiMate to put a reccuring donation of $10 ? You know what, I'm donating $1 every month. It took me 1 minute to set up some years ago. I call it my monthly coffee. Archi has been downloaded more than 50000 times per year since several years. Even if we removed people who downloaded it just to test it and those who upgraded, we can safely estimate that Archi is used by several thousands of users. If each of them could donate $1 montly, Phil could focus on Archi without limits and create and even better software, in fact this could be a whole suite of applications, of really cool apps.


A real Enterprise
---------------

A very talented Enterprise Architect (and much more) defines an Enterprise as _“a bold endeavour”; an emotive or motivational structure, bounded by shared-vision (purpose), shared-values and mutual commitments._ (yes [Tom](http://weblog.tetradian.com/), I'm talking about you).

We very much recognize Archi in this definition: Archi is an Enterprise... **Archi is an Enterprise!**

Archi goal and vision is to provide an open and interoperable toolset for Enterprise Architects. That’s the reason why in addition to ArchiMate, Archi also contains sketches and canvas. More than that, Archi is a platform on which one can build its own Enterprise Architecture solution (through plugins). You know what, The most important for us is not to do software to make money, but to have money to do the best EA software ever. To paraphrase the [Rework book](https://37signals.com/rework), we don't want to sell Archi to Fortune 500 but to Fortune 5,000,000. We don't want few customers to pay a lot, but instead lots of customers paying a few (and without sacrifying the opensource aspect of Archi).


A toolset created by Architects for Architects
--------------------------------------

Current EA tools are bad. All. No exceptions!

As Tom Graves explained in [several posts](http://weblog.tetradian.com/?s=toolset&submit=Go), EA tools fail in two ways: they only focus on modelling already clear ideas where most of Architecture work is on unclear ideas (or even just finding ideas), and if one decides to use some tools made for that purpose (like mindmapping or concept mapping tools), these tools can't work together. That's exactly what we'd like to solve with Archi.

Imagine what an Archi toolset could be:

 * Web based but useable also offline
 * Multi users with real-time collaboration
 * Powerful scripting, analytic and reporting engine
 * Useable also without UI from a command line
 * Compatible with ArchiMate version x (whatever x is)
 * Include some kind of concept/mind mapping
 * Allow to migrate rough ideas captured as sketch (or through concept/mind mapping) to more clearly defined concepts
 * Allow to create visually appealing presentation from ArchiMate diagrams
 * Export to several open formats
 * Etc...

Seems interresting. Personnaly I'd love to use such toolset in my day to day job, not you?


Future is in your hands
---------------------

Future is not written, one could dream that tomorrow some companies will understand why Archi does matter and why they have to sponsor it. I'd love this dream to come true but I'm very pessimistic. To be honest, I don't think companies will support Archi, but I'm sure they will be impacted if in 6 months their customers ask them about ArchiMate x and Archi don't implement it (and will never do). So maybe we should just wait and see... Or maybe you should forward this post to people you know who could change things. I'm sure there are people and companies near us that actually like Archi and are willing to help Phil continue his fantastic work. Help me find them.

I do hope you understand: Archi does matter, and not only for me, also for you!
