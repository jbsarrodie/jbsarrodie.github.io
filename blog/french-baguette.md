The french baguette is better
==========================
The customer journey of an hungry man
---------------------------------

[![](/img/french-baguette-1.jpg)]() Some days ago, during a day full of meetings I had to move across Paris around noon. As I were in a hurry (and hungry) I decided to buy a sandwich at a food truck near my office. So I looked at the menu and decided to order a chicken & tomato sandwich. All went well, the man in the truck was nice and sympathetic and a few minutes later I was having a paper bag in hand, ready to go and take a metro nearby. Until then it was a very good customer journey, and things could have been perfect if I had decided at this time to actually not eat the sandwich while walking. "Why?" are you certainly asking. In fact not because of the service (as I said the man was really nice), and certainly not because of the quality of the product (really good indeed). So why? What went wrong?

The real purpose of a sandwitch
----------------------------

If you sometime eat a sandwich, you should know that its main purpose is to be able to eat it _while walking_. And that was exactly the reason why I decided to pick one: I were in a hurry and wanted to eat while going to the metro station. But in my case this was simply not possible for two now obvious reasons:

My sandwich, dessert and bottle of water have been delivered in a paper bag. I really like this idea as it's ecofriendly, but this bag had no handles! Have you ever tried to eat something and (at the same time) hold a bag _without_ handles? I can tell you that this is very difficult. So after some time I finally figured how to managed this (you could be amazed to see what one can put in coat pockets).

If you think my problems were solved you're wrong, and this time because of the product itself, or should I say, because of its design...

The best way to design a sandwich
-----------------------------

[![](/img/french-baguette-2.jpg)]() There are lots of ways to prepare a sandwich. They depend on culture and country, but also on what you intent to put _inside_. Basically there are two kind of designs: the _layered_ one and the _roll_ one. The _layered_ is the one you get when you take a slice of bread, put chicken, potato or whatever you want on it, and then put another slice of bread. This is a good design, except when you add some sauce because then you are likely to end up with souce on your finger (at best) or suit (at worse) in a couple of minutes. The _roll_ is the one you get when you use bread to contain other ingredients. Several variations exist depending on the bread (Pita, wrap, french baguette...), but the advantage other the _layered_ one is that you can put sauce without too many risks.

What went wrong?
--------------

So what went wrong? That's simple: I live in France, so most sandwiches are done with french baguette (and so was mine), but the man in the food truck cut the baguette in two parts (top and bottom) instead of just cutting one side. This was actually a lot easier for him to lay the sauce, and add ingredients, but this ended up with a _layered_ design with sauce, which in turn ended up in sauce on my fingers and suit. To be honest, this was very good and tasty, but was unmanageable to eat while walking. So, if like me you like having some sauce in your sandwich, then the french baguette is better, but make sure it is cut the right way, that's it, on one side only.

Conclusion
---------

This is, in my opinion, a good example of how a customer journey can be influenced by some small things related to the way you package your product (a handleless paper bag) or the way you optimize you production process (cut baguette in two parts). Never forget to keep focus on the real, basic needs. Whatever you're gonna add to enhance your product will be lost if you don't cover the basic expectations of your customers.
