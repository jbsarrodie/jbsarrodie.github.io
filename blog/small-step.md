One small step for a man
======================

**...one minor leap for mankind**

I've done it. After several years, I've finally done it! One of my passions in life is to share ideas and knowledge with friends and collegues. I've struggled with the question of how to share it efficiently and to as many people as possible. At first, creating a site or a blog seemed too pretentious to me, but finally the freedom offered made me change my mind and [here](http://art.chitectu.re) it is.

The first posts will be copies of old documentation I wrote for myself some years ago. Newer posts will follow.
